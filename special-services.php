				<h2 class="underline underline-is-white underline-is-left">Emergency Evacuations</h2>

				<p>An emergency action plan describes the actions employees should take to ensure their safety if a fire or other emergency situation occurs. Well developed emergency plans and proper employee training (such that employees understand their roles and responsibilities within the plan) will result in fewer and less severe employee injuries and less structural damage to the facility during emergencies. A poorly prepared plan, likely will lead to a disorganized evacuation or emergency response, resulting in confusion, injury, and property damage.</p>
				
				<p>We will develop a custom emergency evacuation plan that is specific for your unique building and office layout.  In addition, we will provide on-going training and practice drills when appropriate.</p>
