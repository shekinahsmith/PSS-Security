				<p>Professional Security Service provides outstanding security services for Gated Communities and High-Rise Communities.  A gated community is a form of residential community sometimes characterized by a closed perimeter of walls and fences, but always containing controlled entrances for pedestrians, bicycles, package delivery, service vehicles, and automobiles. Gated communities usually consist of small residential streets and include various amenities. For smaller communities this may be only a park or other common area. For larger communities, it may be possible for residents to stay within the community for most day-to-day activities.</p>
				
				<p>Most gated communities, usually called guard-gated communities, are staffed by private security guards and services such as we offer, often with closed-circuit TV monitoring and other electronic aides. These communities are often home to high-value properties, while some gated communities are set up as retirement villages.</p>

				<p>For our High-Rise Community clients, we provide a complete array of security services, including our Standing Guard program of armed and/or unarmed uniformed security officers.</p>
