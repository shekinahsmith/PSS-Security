				<p>The goal in providing a Security Assessment for your corporation  is to establish an independent inspection and assessment to determine the effectiveness of your safeguards  and security policies and procedures, including the implementation across the company.</p>

				<p>Electronic security is absolutely crucial to keeping your data, property and people safe from unwanted intruders. But how much money should you invest in security technologies? What types of technology should you purchase? Which business assets require the most stringent security measures?</p> 

				<div class="additional-info is-hidden">
					<p>These are not easy questions to answer without methodically assessing the security needs of your business. You need to determine what security threats are lurking, the areas where you are most vulnerable, and the best ways to mitigate your business risk.</p>

					<p>A security assessment provides a snapshot of your business security readiness - only then can you clearly see where the gaps are and what you need to do to close them.</p>

					<p>We can help your business perform risk assessments covering IT hardware and software, employee training, and work processes. These risk assessments are necessary to ensure that you can identify your overall security posture.</p>
