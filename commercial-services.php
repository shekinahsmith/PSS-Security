				<p>The purpose of offering training services for employee safety is to establish guidance with respect to providing safety training to employees.</p>

				<p>Our objective to working with you and your company is to ensure that employees are familiar with any hazards associated with their jobs and to reduce the potential for accidents that may cause injury, and/or illness, to themselves or the public.</p>

				<div class="additional-info is-hidden">
					
					<p>Safety education is important for several reasons. A task completed safely will also be completed correctly, efficiently, and with a high degree of satisfaction. Also, OSHA requires employers to follow established safe work procedures. The requirement assumes that employees have been instructed and that it is the employer's duty to ensure that they have been.  We customize the employee safety program to your unique needs.</p>

				<h2 class="underline underline-is-white underline-is-left">Emergency Evacuations</h2>

				<p>An emergency action plan describes the actions employees should take to ensure their safety if a fire or other emergency situation occurs. Well developed emergency plans and proper employee training (such that employees understand their roles and responsibilities within the plan) will result in fewer and less severe employee injuries and less structural damage to the facility during emergencies. A poorly prepared plan, likely will lead to a disorganized evacuation or emergency response, resulting in confusion, injury, and property damage.</p>
				
				<p>We will develop a custom emergency evacuation plan that is specific for your unique building and office layout.  In addition, we will provide on-going training and practice drills when appropriate.</p>
